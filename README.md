# Enhancements
Adds various extra features into Beat Saber like a clock and volume adjustment!

## What it adds
- Breaktime: A notification which appears during times of no notes and gives the time until the next note comes.
- Clock: Adds a customizable clock into the game.
- Volume: Control the individual hit sound, miss sound, music sound, song preview sound, and menu background noise.
- Button Lock: Enable to temporarily lock the pause menu buttons for a short time when you pause the game to avoid accidentally pressing them

## Custom Breaktime Assets
In order to add your own Breaktime images and audio, it's pretty simple.
- (If it doesn't exist), create a folder named Breaktime in your UserData folder.
- Create a new folder in the Breaktime folder, name it something recongnizable.
- Put an image into the folder you created named "image.png", "image.gif", or "image.jpg". Supports png, gif, jpg, and apng formats.
- Put an audio (.wav) file into the folder you created named "audio.wav".
- Launch the game and open the mod settings menu. If you setup everything right the profile dropdown should have the name of the folder you created.
- You only need an image or audio file, you don't NEED both.
